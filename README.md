# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in JAX

## Introduction to GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a revolutionary idea in the field of machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning. They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates data (like images), while the discriminator evaluates them. Together, they improve each other's performance.

For a detailed understanding, refer to the original paper: [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Ian Goodfellow et al.

## JAX and FLAX Setup

This guide will help you set up JAX, Flax, and Optax in your Jupyter Notebook environment for high-performance machine learning research.

### Steps to Install

1. **Open a New Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - Start by opening your Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. **Install JAX**: 
   - JAX can be installed directly in your notebook. Run the following command in a cell to install JAX for a CPU-only version:
     ```python
     pip install --upgrade jax jaxlib
     ```
   - For a GPU-enabled version, you'll need to install specific versions based on your CUDA setup. Refer to the [JAX GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for detailed instructions.

3. **Install Flax and Optax**: 
   - Flax and Optax can also be installed via pip directly in your notebook:
     ```python
     pip install flax optax
     ```

### Post-Installation

After installing the packages, you can import and use them in your notebook:

```python
import jax
import flax
import optax
